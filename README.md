### üß¨ What is a genetic Algorithm?
According to wikipedia: a genetic algorithm (GA) is a metaheuristic inspired by the process of natural selection that belongs to the larger class of evolutionary algorithms (EA). <a href= "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_algorithm">Full article</a></br>
### üßê What is it used for?
Genetic algorithms are commonly used to generate high-quality solutions to optimization and search problems by relying on biologically inspired operators such as mutation, crossover and selection. According to <a href= "https://www.brainz.org/15-real-world-applications-genetic-algorithms/">this article</a>, genetic algorithms are used in a wide range of problems such as: </br>
- Automotive Design</br>
- Engineering Design</br>
- Robotics</br>
- Evolvable Hardware</br>
- Optimized Telecommunications Routing</br>
- Joke and Pun Generation</br>
- Biomimetic Invention</br>
- Trip, Traffic and Shipment Routing</br>
- Computer Gaming</br>
- Encryption and Code Breaking</br>
- Computer-Aided Molecular Design</br>
